# TurnBasedPlatformer_WeeklyGameJam193
Created in a team of 3 for weekly game jam 183, Theme: Turn based platformer

Genre: 2D platformer

For this jam we did a play on words with the theme, instead of it being a 
turn based platformer we made a game in which the player is platforming and the 
world itself is turning around the player.

The players goal is to keep climbing up the various obsticles in their path 
to reach the heavens. The player will fail contiously and will have to 
persevere in order to win the game.

Made in Unity with Oisín and Cillín Ivory.
